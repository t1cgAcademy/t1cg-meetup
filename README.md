# t1cg-meetup

This project is an ongoing project being developed during T1CG WebDev meetups held every second Wesdnesday of every month.

We hope to have meetup participants review, play with, and contribute to the project.

Below are some instructions and guidelines to help get you started.

Happy Coding ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€ ðŸ¤˜
